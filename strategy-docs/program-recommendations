# üõ°Ô∏è Oscorp Security Program Recommendations

This document outlines unified strategic recommendations to strengthen Oscorp's cybersecurity posture. Each recommendation consolidates related controls and aligns to NIST CSF functional areas.

## 1. üèõÔ∏è Establish a Formal Cybersecurity Governance Framework

**Unifies:**
- Security roles and responsibilities  
- Cyber risk appetite statement  
- Risk management process endorsement  
- Executive and board training  
- Policy development (InfoSec, classification, governance)  
- Continuous improvement  

**Recommendation:**  
Establish a formal cybersecurity governance program anchored by executive sponsorship. Define cyber roles and responsibilities, implement an information security policy suite, and articulate Oscorp‚Äôs cyber risk appetite. Integrate cyber risk into enterprise risk management (ERM) by aligning with financial, operational, and legal stakeholders. Launch governance training for board members and establish mechanisms for ongoing program review and maturity tracking.

> üí° *Include: build a dedicated cybersecurity team structure to support these functions.*

## 2. üß© Implement a Centralized Identity & Access Management (IAM) Program

**Unifies:**
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
- Privileged access management (PAM)  
- Elimination of shared credentials  
- Least privilege enforcement & separation of duties (SoD)  
- Access reviews and audits  
- Privileged user training  

**Recommendation:**  
Deploy a centralized IAM platform that enforces MFA for users and remote access, implements PAM for administrative accounts, and eliminates shared credentials. Establish policies for least privilege and SoD, and conduct regular access reviews. Launch targeted training for users with elevated access rights.

## 3. üõ†Ô∏è Develop and Execute a Formal Vulnerability & Threat Management Program

**Unifies:**
- Qualys-based scanning and remediation lifecycle  
- Threat intelligence integration  
- Threat and risk assessments  
- Impact and likelihood modeling  
- Risk prioritization and remediation tracking  
- Zero-day and post-incident vulnerability response  

**Recommendation:**  
Transform the current ad hoc scanning approach into a structured vulnerability management program. Use Qualys for regular scans, integrate threat intelligence feeds (e.g., CISA, MS Threat Intel), and develop a formal risk analysis methodology. Track remediation efforts with defined SLAs and implement processes for rapid response to emerging threats.

## 4. ü§ù Build a Third-Party & SaaS Risk Management Program

**Unifies:**
- Vendor/SaaS cataloging  
- Third-party classification and onboarding  
- Cybersecurity in contracts  
- Breach notification and audit trail requirements  
- Third-party awareness and training  

**Recommendation:**  
Establish a Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) program that classifies vendors based on criticality and data access. Include cybersecurity terms in contracts and require breach notifications. Implement a lightweight vendor onboarding process and provide awareness materials for external partners.

## 5. üîê Implement a Comprehensive Data Protection Strategy

**Unifies:**
- Data discovery and classification  
- DLP for data at rest, in transit, and in use  
- USB and removable media controls  
- Data destruction policies  
- Data governance and labeling  

**Recommendation:**  
Launch a data protection initiative that includes formal classification of sensitive data, implementation of DLP across cloud and endpoint environments, and enforcement of controls on USB/media use. Define and implement a secure data disposal policy for end-of-life hardware and digital assets.

---

## 6. üß† Deploy a Security Awareness & Role-Based Training Program

**Unifies:**
- General employee security awareness  
- Executive and board training  
- Privileged user education  
- Third-party stakeholder awareness  

**Recommendation:**  
Evolve Oscorp‚Äôs awareness efforts into a formal training program tailored by role. Require annual refresher courses for all staff, deliver cyber governance modules to executives and board members, and establish training for privileged users and third-party partners as part of onboarding and contract enforcement.

## 7. üïµÔ∏è Implement Detection, Logging & Incident Response Capabilities

**Unifies:**
- SIEM deployment and log aggregation  
- Threat detection and alert analysis  
- Incident response planning and playbooks  
- Escalation paths and communication protocols  
- Post-incident reviews and lessons learned  

**Recommendation:**  
Deploy a SIEM platform to centralize log collection and correlate activity across endpoints, firewalls, and SaaS platforms. Define roles and escalation paths for detection and response, and develop a formal incident response plan with supporting playbooks. Include tabletop exercises and integrate lessons learned into future detection tuning.
