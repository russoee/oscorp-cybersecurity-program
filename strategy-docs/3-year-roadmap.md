# üó∫Ô∏è Oscorp 3-Year Cybersecurity Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a phased implementation plan for strengthening Oscorp‚Äôs cybersecurity posture. It balances foundational improvements, operational maturity, and long-term strategic resilience across three phases.

---

## üöÄ Phase 1: Foundations & Risk Visibility (0‚Äì6 Months)

**Primary Goals:**
- Establish governance and risk ownership  
- Address critical access and detection gaps  
- Set up baseline tooling (e.g., SIEM, PAM, MFA, asset inventory)  

**Key Initiatives:**

| Domain | Actions |
|--------|---------|
| **Governance** | Define cyber roles, approve InfoSec policies, establish risk appetite |
| **Risk Management** | Endorse risk process, begin enterprise risk register, draft risk models |
| **IAM** | Implement MFA (user & VPN), eliminate shared credentials |
| **Vulnerability Mgmt** | Launch formal VM program using Qualys, track remediation |
| **Data Protection** | Begin data classification, block USB usage |
| **Detection & Response** | Deploy SIEM, begin log aggregation (O365, endpoints, firewalls) |
| **Awareness & Training** | Roll out executive/board cyber training, privileged user education |
| **Org Design** | Hire or designate CISO/interim security lead, begin cyber team planning |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Operational Maturity & Program Buildout (6‚Äì18 Months)

**Primary Goals:**
- Scale core programs (IAM, VM, TPRM, IR)  
- Introduce role-specific processes  
- Expand logging, training, and threat modeling  

**Key Initiatives:**

| Domain | Actions |
|--------|---------|
| **Governance** | Launch policy suite (classification, data governance, change mgmt) |
| **Risk Management** | Refine impact/likelihood modeling, formalize risk response tracking |
| **IAM** | Deploy PAM, conduct regular access reviews, enforce SoD policies |
| **Vulnerability Mgmt** | Integrate threat intelligence, begin post-incident patch processes |
| **Third-Party Risk (TPRM)** | Launch vendor classification, onboarding, and contract clauses |
| **Data Protection** | Expand DLP to cover in-transit/in-use; implement formal disposal policy |
| **Detection & Response** | Finalize IR Plan, develop playbooks, define alert severity/escalation |
| **Awareness & Training** | Launch annual all-staff refresher program, third-party onboarding |
| **Org Design** | Build core security team (analyst, IAM lead, vulnerability mgr) |

## üß± Phase 3: Strategic Resilience & Continuous Improvement (18‚Äì36 Months)

**Primary Goals:**
- Mature programs into repeatable, optimized processes  
- Expand threat detection, response testing, and external partnerships  
- Begin Zero Trust and advanced monitoring planning  

**Key Initiatives:**

| Domain | Actions |
|--------|---------|
| **Governance** | Review cyber risk posture quarterly, refine policies via feedback loop |
| **Risk Management** | Fully integrate cyber into ERM; align with finance/legal/procurement |
| **IAM** | Tune access policies based on usage analytics and detection insights |
| **TPRM** | Monitor vendor SLAs, request SOC2 reports, manage breach disclosures |
| **Detection & Response** | Run tabletop exercises, incorporate UEBA, join threat-sharing groups |
| **Data Protection** | Review DLP effectiveness, update based on data flow and incidents |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Conduct post-incident reviews, update detection logic and training |
| **Advanced Strategy** | Begin planning for Zero Trust Architecture and UBA integration |
| **Org Design** | Evaluate need for internal SOC vs MSSP, add forensic and GRC roles |

## üîÅ Supporting Actions Across All Phases

| Meta Layer | Ongoing Activity |
|------------|------------------|
| **Executive Oversight** | Assign initiative owners and sponsors |
| **Cyber Risk Reporting** | Present quarterly updates to leadership on posture, maturity, KPIs |
| **Hiring Plan** | Phase hiring based on initiative needs and budget |
| **Tool Selection & Budgeting** | Evaluate and acquire tools (SIEM, PAM, DLP, etc.) in each phase |
