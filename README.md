# 🧬 Oscorp Cybersecurity Capstone

## 🎯 Project Overview

Norman Osborn approached me with an offer to become Oscorp’s **Senior Cybersecurity Consultant**, citing the strength of my prior contributions. The offer was generous — but came with one condition:

Before formally joining, I was asked to design a **comprehensive cybersecurity program** for the organization.

The objectives were clear:

- Conduct an **objective assessment** of Oscorp’s current cybersecurity posture  
- Identify **key deficiencies and risk areas** across people, process, and technology  
- Develop a **realistic, phased 3-year roadmap** to uplift security maturity  
- Align the program with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** to ensure structure and defensibility

This repository documents that work — from initial assessment through strategy development and execution planning.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 📊 Baseline Assessment

A detailed analysis of Oscorp’s current cybersecurity capabilities, gaps, and risk posture:

- [`oscorp-current-state.md`](oscorp-current-state.md) – Initial state analysis of controls, tools, and governance

---

### 🔍 Gap Analysis (`/gap-analysis/`)

Recommendations are broken down by **NIST CSF functional domains** for clarity and traceability:

- [`IDENTIFY.md`](gap-analysis/IDENTIFY.md)  
- [`PROTECT.md`](gap-analysis/PROTECT.md)  
- [`DETECT.md`](gap-analysis/DETECT.md)  
- [`RESPOND.md`](gap-analysis/RESPOND.md)  
- [`RECOVER.md`](gap-analysis/RECOVER.md)

---

### 🧭 Strategic Planning (`/strategy-docs/`)

Broad strategic direction and phased implementation guidance:

- [`program-recommendations.md`](strategy-docs/program-recommendations.md) – Thematic recommendations grouped into core program pillars  
- [`3-year-roadmap.md`](strategy-docs/3-year-roadmap.md) – Time-phased roadmap aligned to foundational, operational, and strategic milestones

---

## 📌 Framework Alignment

All recommendations and plans are aligned to the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), incorporating key concepts from governance, risk management, and control maturity models.

This capstone exercise demonstrates the lifecycle of designing, justifying, and planning a cybersecurity program from the ground up.
